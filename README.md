# Coin-Flip-With-Biases
My first program written in Java. A coin flipping program that can: 1) Emulate a single coin flip. 2) Emulate multiple coin flips (The user specifies how many, the programs runs these tests and returns the summary). 3) Change the bias of the coin.

Update, 28-Jan-2019:
Program tweaked a little to give more variable random values.
